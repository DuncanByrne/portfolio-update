        Hello! My name is Duncan Byrne, I am a web developer from Long Island, New York. I have been coding and building websites for almost two years. I enjoy the process of learning
        different technologies, and putting them to work. I hope to one day work on developing video games, building financial projects and overall just having fun while coding.
