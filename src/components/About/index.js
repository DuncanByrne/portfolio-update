        My name is Duncan Byrne and I am a web developer from Long Island, New York. Currently I am employed at Wells Fargo, where I am an engineers associate
       I love working on the new technologies and helping improve the current technologies that my company uses on a day-to-day basis. I am currently working the financial area of technology, while my passion mainly involves
       working on creating apps and developing websites I do enjoy my job and the challenges it brings on a daily basis.

          I am currently looking to transition more into what I am passionate about which is web development. I Web development is more enjoyable and fulfilling to me personally, because I love the process of 
          working on a project from the ground up and seeing the finished product. I am looking to join a company that has great values like my current company and be surronded with like-minded individuals, 
          who are just as passionate as me.
