        My name is Duncan Byrne and I am a web developer from Long Island, New York. I have been working with JavaScript developing projects for two years. I recently graduated from
        a boot camp with Columbia University where I learned a full MERN stack along with the best common practices. I had a great time learning and collaborating with the profeesor and 
        fellow students. I have also completed almost two years at Suffolk County Community College. I have not finished my degree yet, I stopped because of the global pandemic in 2020 
        and I found what I love to do in that time and I want to make the most of it and find the right company for me. 
      </p>
        <p>
          I am looking to join a company where I can continue to learn and grow as a developer, I believe that in this field the best people to learn from are those with experience. 
          If you want to contact me my e-mail adress is duncanbyrne69@outllok.com, you can also reach out to me on LinkedIn through the button on the bottom of the page. Thank you for 
          checking out my portfolio, have a great day and I hope to hear from you soon!
